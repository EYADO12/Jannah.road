        <h1>The beginning of Islam</h1>
        <p>The start of Islam is marked in the year 610, following the first revelation to the prophet Muhammad at the age of 40. Muhammad and his followers spread the teachings of Islam throughout the Arabian peninsula. Soon after the death of the prophet Muhammad, there were military expeditions, called "futuhat," or literally "openings," into what is now Egypt and other parts of North Africa. In other parts of the world, Islam spread through trade and commerce. The following is a brief timeline that highlights some of the major occurrences in Islam's development, as well as the geographical spread of Islam to some of the countries featured in the film.</p>


        <p> 570 C.E. Muhammad is born in Mecca. He comes from a noble family and is well-known for his honesty and upright character.</p>

        <p>610 C.E. at the age of 40, Muhammad is visited by the angel Gabriel while on retreat in a cave near Mecca. The angel recites to him the first revelations of the Quran and informs him that he is God's prophet. Later, Muhammad is told to call his people to the worship of the one God, but they react with hostility and begin to persecute him and his followers.</p>

        <p>622 C.E. After enduring persecution in Mecca, Muhammad and his followers migrate to the nearby town of Yathrib (later to be known as Medina), where the people there accepted Islam. This marks the "hijrah" or "emigration," and the beginning of the Islamic calendar. In Medina, Muhammad establishes an Islamic state based on the laws revealed in the Quran and the inspired guidance coming to him from God. Eventually he begins to invite other tribes and nations to Islam.</p>

        <p>630 C.E. Muhammad returns to Mecca with a large number of his followers. He enters the city peacefully, and eventually all its citizens accept Islam. The prophet clears the idols and images out of the Kaaba and rededicates it to the worship of God alone.. By the time he died in about 11 AH (632 CE),</p>

        <p>The Muslim community elects his father-in-law and close associate, Abu Bakr, as caliph, or successor.</p>

        <p>638 C.E. Muslims enter the area north of Arabia, known as "Sham," including Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and Iraq.</p>

        <p>641 C.E. Muslims enter Egypt and rout the Byzantine army. Muslims consider their conquest as the liberation of subjugated people, since in most instances they were under oppressive rule.</p>

        <p>655 C.E. Islam begins to spread throughout North Africa.</p>

        <p>661 C.E. Imam Ali is killed, bringing to an end the rule of the four "righteous caliphs": Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali. This also marks the beginning of the Umayyad rule.</p>

        <p>711 C.E. Muslims enter Spain in the west and India in the east. Eventually almost the entire Iberian Peninsula is under Islamic control.</p>

        <p>732 C.E. Muslims are defeated at Potiers in France by Charles Martel.</p>

        <p>750 C.E. The Abbasids take over rule from the Umayyads, shifting the seat of power to Baghdad.</p>

        <p>1000 C.E. Islam continues to spread through the continent of Africa, including Nigeria, which served as a trading liaison between the northern and central regions of Africa.</p>

        <p>1099 C.E. European Crusaders take Jerusalem from the Muslims. Eventually Muslims defeat the Crusaders and regain control of the holy land.</p>

        <p>1120 C.E. Islam continues to spread throughout Asia. Malaysian traders interact with Muslims who teach them about Islam.</p>

        <p>1299 C.E. The earliest Ottoman state is formed in Anatolia, Turkey.</p>

        <p>1453 C.E. Ottomans conquer the Byzantine seat of Constantinople and change its name to Istanbul.</p>

        <p>Circa 1800 C.E. Approximately 30 percent of Africans forced into slavery in the United States are Muslim.</p>

        <p>1870-1924 C.E. Muslim immigrants from the Arab world voluntarily come to the United States until the Asian Exclusion Act is passed in 1924.</p>

        <p>World War I ends with the defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, which was the last of the Islamic empires. Many regions populated by Muslims in Africa and Asia are colonized by Europeans. Traditional religious ways of life are threatened and, in some cases, destroyed.</p>

        <div class="text">
            <h2>Why islam is the correct religion?</h2>

            <p>And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no child who is not born in a state of fitrah, then his parents make him a Jew or a Christian or a Magian, just as animals bring forth animals with their limbs intact, do you see any deformed one among them?” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1358) and Muslim (2658).</p>

            <p>The words “animals bring forth animals with their limbs intact” mean: just as an animal is born with its limbs intact and free of defects; anything that happens to it of cuts to its ears and so on happens after it is born.

                Similarly, every human is born with an inherent inclination towards Islam, and any deviation from Islam is undoubtedly a departure from sound human nature. Therefore, we never find anything in the teachings of Islam that is contrary to sound human nature. Rather all of its teachings on beliefs and practical matters are in accordance with sound human nature. As for religions and ideologies other than Islam, they include things that are contrary to sound human nature. This is something that is quite clear and apparent to anyone who reflects and ponders. </p>

            <h2>Rational evidence</h2>

            <p>There are many Islamic texts that address reason and direct people to examine the rational proof and evidence, and call upon people of sound reasoning and mature thinking to examine the definitive evidence for the soundness of Islam.</p>

            <p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>

            <p>“(This is) a Book (the Quran) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember” [Saad 38:29].</p>

            <p>Al-Qadi ‘Iyad said concerning the miraculous aspects of the Quran:</p>

            <p>“In it you will see that there is an explanation of a set of divine laws; it mentions the way of proof based on reason, presents arguments against the misguided followers of different religions and sects, and argues against them on the basis of strong and clear proof, using very easy and concise language. Those who pretend to be clever tried to come up with proof and evidence like that, but they were not able to do so.” (Ash-Shifa (1/390)
                The texts of the revelation do not contain anything that is impossible according to rational thinking or that would be rejected by reason, and the texts never presented an argument that contradicts reason or contradicts any analogy based on rational thinking. Rather the proponents of falsehood never presented any analogy to support their falsehood but the Quran refuted it on the basis of truth and an argument that is based on clear reason.</p>

            <p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>

            <p>“And no example or similitude do they bring (to oppose or to find fault in you or in this Quran), but We reveal to you the truth (against that similitude or example), and the better explanation thereof” [al-Furqan 25:33].</p>

            <p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>

            <p>“Here Allah, may He be glorified, tells us that the disbelievers do not produce any rational argument to support their falsehood but He refutes it on the basis of truth, and presents arguments and evidence and examples that offer a better explanation thereof, are more convincing and give a clearer explanation of the truth than their argument and analogy.” (Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (4/106)</p>

            <p>One of the examples of rational evidence in the Quran is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>

            <p>“Do they not then consider the Quran carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction” [an-Nisa 4:82].</p>

            <p>In Tafsir al-Qurtubi it says:</p>

            <p>“There is no one who speaks a great deal but you will find a lot of contradictions in his words, either in the presentation and wording, or in the meaning, or you will find discrepancies, or there will be untruths. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, sent down the Quran and instructed them to reflect on it, because they will not find in it any discrepancies in the presentation of ideas, or any flaws in what it promotes, or any contradiction, or any lies in what they are told of matters of the unseen and what they conceal.” (Al-Jami‘ li Ahkam al-Quran (5/290)</p>

            <p>Ibn Kathir said:</p>

            <p>“That is, if it were fabricated and made up, as the ignorant polytheists and hypocrites said to themselves, “they would surely have found therein much contradiction” that is, many flaws and discrepancies. In other words, this Book is free of discrepancies and contradictions, therefore it is from Allah.” (Tafsir al-Quran al-‘Azim (1/802) </p>

            <h2>Miracles and signs of Prophethood</h2>

            <p> Allah, may He be exalted, supported His noble Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with numerous miracles and tangible signs that pointed to the truthfulness of his Prophethood and the soundness of his message, such as the splitting of the moon for him, the glorification of Allah by food and pebbles in front of him, the springing forth of water from between his fingers, the increasing of food, and other miracles and signs that were seen and witnessed by huge numbers of people, and have been transmitted to us via sahih isnads (sound chains of narration) that reach the level of tawatur. This gives rise to certainty.</p>

            <p>An example of that is that which is narrated in a sahih report from ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud, that he said: We were with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a journey and our supply of water ran low. He said: “Bring me a little leftover water.” So they brought a vessel in which there was a little water. He put his hand in the vessel, then said: “Come to a blessed, purifying water; and the blessing is from Allah.” And I saw the water springing from between the fingers of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). And we used to hear the food glorifying Allah as it was being eaten. (Narrated by al-Bukhari (3579)</p>

            <h2>Prophecies</h2>

            <p>What is meant by prophecies here is what the revelation foretold of matters and events that would happen in the future, whether that was during the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or after his death.</p>

            <p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never foretold anything that would happen in the future, but it would happen exactly as he foretold. This indicates that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, had revealed and disclosed to him some matters of unseen knowledge that could not be attained except by means of revelation.</p>

            <p>One example of that is the report narrated by Abu Hurayrah, that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Hour will not begin until a fire emerges in the land of the Hijaz which will illuminate the necks of the camels in Busra.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari (7118) and Muslim (2902)</p>

            <p>And it happened exactly as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had foretold, in 654 AH – approximately 644 years after his death. This was mentioned by historians, including al-‘Allamah Abu Shamah al-Maqdisi, in his book Dhayl ar-Rawdatayn. He was one of the scholars who lived at the time of this historical incident.</p>

            <p>It was also mentioned by al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir in al-Bidayah wa'an-Nihayah (13/219), where he said: Then the year 654 AH began, in which there appeared fire in the land of the Hijaz by which the necks of the camels in Busra were illuminated, as it says in the agreed-upon hadith. Shaykh al-‘Allamah al-Hafiz Shihab ad-Din Abu Shamah al-Maqdisi spoke at length about that in his adh-Dhayl wa Sharhuhu, based on many letters that came to Damascus from the Hijaz, describing that fire that had been witnessed and seen, and how it emerged, and the story thereof.</p>

            <p>To sum up what Abu Shamah said:</p>

            <p>Letters came to Damascus from the Prophet’s City – may the best of blessings and peace be upon its inhabitant – speaking of the emergence of a fire in their land on 5
                th Jumada al-Akhirah this year. The letters were written on 5th Rajab, when the fire was still burning, and they reached us on 10th Sha‘ban. Then he said: In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. At the beginning of Sha‘ban 654 AH, letters came to the city of Damascus from the city of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) describing a significant event that occurred there, in which there was confirmation of the hadith of Abu Hurayrah in as-Sahihayn, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Hour will not begin until a fire emerges in the land of the Hijaz which will illuminate the necks of the camels in Busra.” Someone whom I trust from among those who saw it told me that he heard that in Tayma letters had been written by its light.

                He said: We were in our houses during those nights, and in the house of each one of us it was as if there was a lamp, but it had no heat and did not burn, despite its greatness; rather it was one of the signs of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.”</p>

            <h2>Qualities and attributes of Prophet Muhammad</h2>

            <p>
                One of the greatest proofs of the truthfulness of the Prophethood of the Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is his own character and the noble attributes and great manners with which he was blessed, for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) reached a level of human perfection in terms of good characteristics and attitudes that could only be attained by a Prophet who was sent from Allah.</p>

            <p>There is no praiseworthy characteristic but he promoted it, enjoined it, encouraged it and acted in accordance with it; and there is no blameworthy characteristic but he forbade it, warned against it and was the furthest removed of all people from it.</p>

            <p>His concern for good manners and attitudes reached such an extent that he gave as the reason for his mission the promotion of good attitudes and manners and striving against bad manners and attitudes. In the hadith from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), it tells us that he said: “I have only been sent to perfect good manners and attitudes.” (Narrated by Ahmad (8739). Al-Haythami said in al-Majma‘: It was narrated by Ahmad and its men are the men of as-Sahih.</p>

            <p>Al-'Ajlouni classed its isnad as sahih in Kashf al-Khafa. It was also classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘ (2349)</p>

            <p>Miracles are indicative of the truthfulness of the Messenger. He told the people that he had been sent by Allah, may He be exalted, and some of them challenged him to prove that. So Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, supported him with miracles, which are extraordinary events. And he was also granted miracles without anybody challenging him or claiming that he was lying, which served to increase his followers in steadfastness. </p>

            <h2>The essence of the call of Prophet Muhammad</h2>

            <p> The basis of the call of the noble Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) may be summed up as the aim to build sound beliefs on a sound textual and rational foundation. It is a call to believe in Allah and affirm His oneness in terms of His divinity and lordship. None is deserving of worship except one God, namely Allah, may He be glorified, for He is the Lord, Creator and Sovereign of this universe, Who controls it and disposes of its affairs; He governs it by His command, and is the One Who possesses the power to cause harm or bring benefit, and Who controls the provision of all creatures – and no one has any share of that with Him. Nothing is equal or like unto Him, so He, may He be glorified, is far above having any partners, rivals, peers or equals.</p>

            <p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>

            <p>“Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)): ‘He is Allah, (the) One. ‘Allah-us-Samad (The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor drinks). ‘He begets not, nor was He begotten; ‘And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him’” [al-Ikhlas 112:1-4]</p>

            <p>“Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)): ‘I am only a man like you. It has been inspired to me that your Ilah (God) is One Ilah (God i.e. Allah). So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord '' [al-Kahf 18:110].</p>

            <p>The call of the noble Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was a call to destroy shirk of all kinds and to rid the two races (of mankind and the jinn) of everything that was worshipped on a basis of falsehood. So there is to be no worship of rocks, stars and graves, or of wealth, whims and desires, or the tyrannical rulers of the earth.</p>

            <p>Rather it is a call that came to liberate humanity from the worship of other people and to bring them forth from the humiliation of idolatry and the oppression of tyrants, and to free them from the captivity of whims and desires.</p>

            <p>This blessed call is regarded as a continuation and affirmation of the previous divinely revealed messages that called to belief in the oneness of Allah. Therefore Islam called people to believe in all the messengers and prophets, and to respect them and venerate them, and to believe in the Books that were revealed to them. A call such as this is undoubtedly true.</p>

            <h2>Foretelling of Islam</h2>

            <p>The Books of the prophets foretold the coming of Islam and the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The Noble Quran tells us of the clear foretelling of the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in the Torah and Gospel, including cases where his name and description are clearly mentioned.</p>

            <p>Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>

            <p>“Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) whom they find written with them in the Taurat (Torah) (Deut, xviii, 15) and the Injeel (Gospel) (John xiv, 16), - he commands them for Al-Ma’ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibat ((i.e. all good and lawful) as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabaith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allah’s Covenant), and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them” [al-A‘raf 7:157]</p>

            <p>“And (remember) when ‘Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), said: O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah unto you confirming the Taurat ((Torah) which came) before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad” [as-Saff 61:6].</p>

            <p>In the books of the Jews and the Christians – the Torah and the Gospel – there are still glad tidings that foretell his coming and his message, and describe some of his characteristics, despite the continual attempts to erase and distort these glad tidings. An example of that is what is mentioned in the Book of Deuteronomy, 33:2:</p>

            <p>“The Lord came from Sinai and dawned over them from Seir; he shone forth from Mount Paran… ” [New International Version]</p>

            <p>It says in Mu‘jam al-Buldan (3/301):</p>

            <p>“Paran is a Hebrew word that is Arabized as Faran. It is one of the names of Makkah that is mentioned in the Torah, and it was said that it is a name for the mountains of Makkah.</p>

            <p>Ibn Makula Abu Bakr Nasr ibn al-Qasim ibn Quda‘ah al-Quda‘i al-Farani al-Iskandarani said: I heard that this refers to the mountains of Paran, which are the mountains of the Hijaz.</p>

            <p>And in the Torah it says: Allah came from Sinai and dawned from Seir and shone forth from Paran.</p>

            <p>His coming from Sinai refers to His speaking to Musa (peace be upon him). His dawning from Seir – which refers to the mountains of Palestine – refers to His sending down the Gospel to ‘Isa (peace be upon him). And His shining forth from the mountains of Paran refers to His sending down the Quran to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).”</p>

            <h2>The Noble Quran as a proof of the validity of Islam</h2>

            <p>This is the greatest of miracles and signs, and the clearest of proof. It is the ultimate proof of Allah against His creation on the Day of Resurrection. It is miraculous from several angles, such as rhetorical, scientific, and legislative, and in the way in which it spoke of future events and unseen matters.</p>

            <h2>Commentary on at-Tur 52:34</h2>

            <p>With regard to what is meant by the verse (interpretation of the meaning), “Let them then produce a recital like unto it (the Quran) if they are truthful” [at-Tur 52:34], it is a response to those who claimed that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was making up the Quran by himself.</p>

            <p>Therefore the Quran challenged them to produce something like it, if they were telling the truth in their claim, because the implication of these claims was that this was something within the capability of human beings. If that was true, then what was preventing them from producing something like it, when they were masters of eloquence and rhetoric?</p>

            <p>Allah challenged the disbelievers to produce something like it, but they were unable to do that, as the Quran tells us (interpretation of the meaning):</p>

            <p>“Say: ‘If mankind and the jinns were together to produce the like of this Quran, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another’” [al-Isra 17:88].</p>

            <p>And He challenged them to produce ten surahs like it, but they were unable to do that:</p>

            <p>“Or, they say, ‘He has forged it.’ Say, ‘Then bring ten chapters similarly forged and call for aid from whom you can besides Allah, if what you say is the truth’” [Hud 11:13].</p>

            <p>And He challenged them to produce a single surah like it, but they were unable to do that:</p>

            <p>“And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Quran) to Our slave (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), then produce a Surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful” [al-Baqarah 2:23].</p>

            <p>With regard to the nature of the miracle with which the Quran challenged them , the scholars differed concerning that. There are several views, the most likely of which to be correct is what al-Alusi said:</p>

            <p>“The Quran as a whole, and parts of it, even the shortest surah of it, is a miracle in terms of its composition and eloquence, and its speaking of the unseen, and its harmony with reason and its precise meanings. All these aspects may appear in one verse, or some of them may not be present, such as telling of the unseen. There is no harm in that and no flaw, because what is there is sufficient.” (Ruh al-Ma‘ani (1/29)</p>

            <p>All the proofs mentioned above in general terms may be discussed in much more detail, but we do not have room to do so here. It is more appropriate to read about that in specialised books. Every Muslim is advised to seek knowledge of the Quran and Sunnah, and to study the books of correct ‘aqidah, and to learn about his religion so that he can be a good Muslim and worship his Lord with understanding.</p>

        <h1>Rules of salat</h1>

        <p>Salat is the best among all acts of worship. If it is accepted by the Almighty Allah, other acts of worship are also accepted. And, if prayers are not accepted, other acts are also not accepted. </p>

        <p>Offering of prayers five times during day and night purifies us of sins in the same manner as bathing five times during day and night makes our body clean of all filth and dirt. </p>

        <p>It is befitting that one should offer prayers punctually. A person who considers prayers to be something ordinary and unimportant is just like one who does not offer prayers at all. The holy Prophet has said that a person who does not attach any importance to prayers and considers it to be something insignificant deserves chastisement in the hereafter. </p>

        <p>Once, while the holy Prophet was present in the Mosque (i.e. Masjidun Nabi), a man entered and began offering prayers but did not perform the Ruku’ and Sajdah properly. The holy Prophet said: “If this man dies and his prayers continue to be this way, he will not depart on my religion”. Hence, one should not offer one’s prayers hurriedly. While offering prayers one should remember Allah constantly and should offer the prayers humbly and with all solemnity. One should keep in mind the Greatness of Almighty Allah with whom one communes while offering prayers and should consider oneself to be very humble and insignificant before His Grandeur and Glory. And if a person keeps himself absorbed in these thoughts while performing prayers he becomes unmindful and oblivious to himself, just as when an arrow was pulled out of the foot of the Commander of the Faithful, Imam Ali (peace be on him) while he was offering prayers but he did not become aware of it. </p>

        <p>Furthermore, one who performs prayers should be repentant and should refrain from all sins and especially those which are an impediment in the way of acceptance of one’s prayers (e.g. jealousy, pride, backbiting, eating haraam things, drinking intoxicating beverages, non-payment of Khums and Zakat). In fact, he should refrain from all sins. Similarly, he should avoid acts which diminish the reward for prayers like praying when one is drowsy or restless because of an urge to urinate, and while offering prayers he should not look up towards the sky. On the other hand, one should perform such acts which increase the reward like wearing an Aqiq, wearing clean clothes, combing the hair, brushing the teeth and using perfum

        </div>

        <h1>RULES REGARDING SALAT TIMES</h1>

        <p>Issue 750: * A person can start offering prayers only when be becomes certain that the time has set in or when two just (Adil) persons inform that the time has set in. In fact, one can rely upon the Adhan, or on advice of a person who knows the timings and is reliable.</p>

        <p>Issue 751: * If a person cannot be certain about the Prime time for prayers due to a personal handicap like blindness or being in the prison cell, he should delay the prayer till such time when he feels sure that the time has set in. And as an obligatory precaution, he should act the same way when there are general hindrances like dust or clouds.</p>

        <p>Issue 752: * If a person is satisfied on the basis of any one of the above methods that the time for prayers has set in and he begins offering prayers, but then realises during the prayers that the time has not yet set in, his prayer is void. And the position is the same if he realises after the prayers that he has offered the entire prayers before time. However, if one learns as he prays that the time has just entered or if he learns after the prayers that the time entered while he was in the process of praying, his Salat will be valid.</p>

        <p>Issue 753: If a person is heedless of the fact that he should pray after ensuring that the time has set in, and if he realises after the prayers that he had offered the entire prayers in time, his prayer is in order. And if he realises that he had offered his prayers before time or does not realise whether he had offered the prayers within time or not, his prayers will be void. In fact, if he realises after offering prayers that the time for prayers had set in while he was praying, he should offer that prayers again.</p>

        <p>Issue 754: If a person was certain that the time for prayers had set in, and began offering prayers but while praying, he doubted whether or not the time for it had actually set in, his prayers would be void. However, if he is certain while offering prayers that the time for it has set in, but doubts whether what he has already performed in the prayer, has been in time or not, his prayer is valid.</p>

        <p>Issue 755: If the time left for Salat is so little that if we perform some Mustahab acts of the prayers, an obligatory part of the prayers will fall beyond the prescribed time, one should not perform those Mustahab acts. For example, if on account of reciting qunut a part of the prayers will lapse beyond time, one should do without qunut.</p>

        <p>Issue 756: If the time at the disposal of a person is sufficient for performing one Rak’at only he should offer the prayers with the Niyyat of Ada, i.e. offering the same in time. However, one should not delay offering prayers intentionally.</p>

        <p>Issue 757: * If a person who is not a traveller has at his disposal time for offering five Rak’ats till sunset he should offer both Zuhr and Asr prayers. And if he has less time than that he should offer only Asr prayers, and thereafter he should give Qadha of Zuhr prayers. Similarly if he has sufficient time upto midnight for offering five Rak’ats, he should offer Maghrib and Isha prayers and if he has less time than that he should offer only Isha prayers and then offer Maghrib prayers, without making a Niyyat of Ada (i.e. being in time) or Qadha.</p>

        <p>Issue 758: * If a person who is a traveller has sufficient time at his disposal till sunset for offering three Rak’ats he should offer Zuhr and Asr prayers and if he has lesser time than that, he should offer only Asr prayers and then offer Qadha of Zuhr prayers. And if he has time enough for offering 4 Rak’ats till midnight he should offer Maghrib and Isha prayers, and if he has just enough time for three Rak’ats he should offer Isha first and then Maghrib so that at least one Rak’at falls within time. And if the time is for lesser than three Rak’ats, then he should first offer Isha prayers, followed by Maghrib without the Niyyat of Ada or Qadha. However, if he learns after completing Isha prayers that there is still time for at least one Rak’at, or more, he should hasten to offer Maghrib with the Niyyat of Ada.</p>

        <p>Issue 759: It is Mustahab that a person should offer prayers at the Prime time prescribed for it, and great emphasis has been laid on it; alternatively, the nearer the prayers are to its Prime time, the better, except where there is good reason for delay, like, waiting to join the prayers in congregation (Salat al-Jamaat).</p>

        <p>Issue 760: * If a person has a justifiable excuse for offering prayers with tayammum and he wishes to offer it at the Prime time knowing that his excuse will continue till the end of the prescribed time, or having no hope for redress, he can offer prayers in the early part of the time. But if he has a hope that the excuse will cease to exist, he should wait till his excuse is removed. In case his excuse is not removed, he would offer prayers in the last part of the time. But, in so doing, it is not necessary that he should wait so much that he may be able to perform only the obligatory acts of the prayers. In fact, if he has time for the Mustahab acts like Adhan, Iqamah and qunut as well, he can perform tayammum and offer prayers along with these Mustahab acts. As for other excuses which do not justify tayammum, it is permissible for him to offer prayers at its Prime time, even if he has not lost hope about redress. However, if the excuse actually ceases to exist while he is praying, he must repeat the prayers.</p>

        <p>Issue 761: * If a person does not know the rules about prayers, doubts occurring in it, or about the forgotten parts, and if he feels that such problems would probably arise in his Salat , he should defer from its Prime time so as to learn the relevant rules. However, if he is hopeful that he can offer prayers correctly he may pray at its Prime time. And if no problem arose during the prayers, his prayers would be correct and valid. But if a problem arose and the rules relating to it were not known to him, he would be allowed to act on one of the two probabilities and complete the prayers. And, after the prayers, he should enquire about the rule so that if his prayers had been void he would offer it again, and if it had been valid, he need not repeat.</p>

        <p>Issue 762: If there is ample time for prayers, and at the same time his creditor demands repayment of his loan from him, he should repay the loan first, if possible, and then offer prayers. Similarly, if there emerges another obligatory matter which demands immediate attention, like if a man sees that the Masjid is Najis he should make it Clean (tahir/pak) first and then offer prayers. And in both the cases if he offers his prayers first he commits a sin but his prayer is in order.</p>

    <section class="adhkar" id="adhkar">
        <h2>What is Adhkar?</h2>

        <p>Linguistically, azkar or adhkar is the plural of dhikr which means "remembrance, reminder" or "mention, utterance". To understand the word at a deeper meaning, adhkar is defined as the remembrance of Allah very often with those legislated duas or supplications, such as saying "Glory be to Allah" and "All Praise be to Allah".</p>

        <h2>What are the benefits of Adhkar?</h2>

        <h3>1. Adhkar removes the rust of your heart and purifies it</h3>

        <p>Every Muslim has fallen into sin, whether conscious or unconscious. The longer we live without the remembrance of Allah and repentance, the rust accumulates more on our hearts, causing us to feel insensitive and indifferent towards sin. However, with daily adhkar, it will help you purify and soften your heart, InshaAllah.</p>

        <h1>كَلَّا ۖ بَلْ ۜ رَانَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَكْسِبُونَ</h1>
        <blockquote>Nay, but that which they have earned is rust upon their hearts. [Qur’an 83:14]</blockquote>

        <h3>2. Daily adhkar enhances your relationship with Allah</h3>

        <p>Imagine you miss someone who’s still alive, what would you do? Of course, you would make the effort to communicate with them through text or call just to hear their voice and all you think about is them. Having a close relationship with Allah really is about remembering Him at all times, and one of the ways you can remember Him is through daily adhkar.
            When you begin to always remember Him in your breath, your utterances, you start to depend on Allah for all things and detach yourself from the deception of the world, as well as other people. Allah loves the one who praises and glorifies Him, and it is through Allah’s love and mercy towards you that your du’as are answered. This is a very special relationship that is especially experienced through this easy, pure and excellent form of worship.</p>

        <h3>3. Allah will Love and Remember those who remember Him</h3>

        <p>This is an exceptional relationship between Allah and His Servants. It takes utmost care and devotion to love Allah and fill the days with morning and evening adhkar, and Allah promises to Love and Remember those who remember Him. He has stated in the Qur’an</p>

        <h1>فَٱذْكُرُونِىٓ أَذْكُرْكُمْ وَٱشْكُرُوا۟ لِى وَلَا تَكْفُرُونِ</h1>
        <blockquote>So remember Me; I will remember you. Be thankful to Me, and never ungrateful.[Qur’an 2:152]</blockquote>

        <h3>4. Reciting Adhkar with mindfulness is a sign of gratitude</h3>

        <p>Sometimes when you feel sad and lonely, and nothing seems right, daily adhkar can really be helpful to reset your mind on a more positive note. By praising and glorifying Allah, we are showing our gratitude to Him and acknowledging His majesty. We are acknowledging that we He is the Greatest and that we are powerless without Him. Once we grasp this concept, we can understand that we are not actually in control of our lives, and it is only with the help and will of Allah that we can achieve things in our lives.</p>

        <h3>5. Daily Adhkar can protect you from enemies</h3>

        <p>In a list of adhkar we will show you later on, there are some recitations which can help you protect yourself from all harm, InshaAllah. If you truly recite the morning and evening litanies with an open mind and heart and full confidence, InshaAllah you will be protected from all the bad and evil of the world such as evil eye, envy, black magic and more.</p>

        <h3>6. It’s the Simplest Act of Worship</h3>

        <p>Compared to all other acts of worship, reciting adhkar is considered to be the simplest act of worship which you can do anytime of the day, while doing anything at all. If you're doing household chores or simply lying down, you can still recite dhikr with a full mind and heart. Try this one day and feel the difference it makes spiritually, emotionally and mentally, InshaAllah.</p>

        <h3>7. It Helps you to Withstand from Sinning</h3>

        <p>When our mind is absent from the remembrance of Allah, we rarely give thought about our deeds whether it is beneficial or sinful. Hence, when we remember Allah, we will do away from committing sins as we know that Allah is watching over us and He Sees everything we do. When we are conscious of this matter, we will feel fear and try our best to withstand the temptations of Shaytaan.</p>

        <h3>8. It Calms Your Mind</h3>

        <p>Remembering Allah the Glorious and speaking to Him ensures peace and serenity of the mind, as well as, success in this life and the Hereafter. If you are afflicted with anxiety, fear, and other negative emotions, adhkar helps to ease your worries and trust in the Divine Decree of Allah. It would be difficult at first, but when you try and make it a habit to recite dhikr and believe in Allah, you will feel empowered and more positive, InshaAllah.</p>
